# [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com) Mini-BootCamp

https://lambdaschool.com/mini-bootcamp/javascript

## Lesson One
### "Introduction to JavaScript"
- [LESSON ONE](https://youtu.be/fjjebMXE-P8)
"This introductory lesson covers variables and operators, functions, data types, and the Math object. It also touches lightly on Node, GitHub, and npm.  

By the time you finish this lesson (and the accompanying homework) you should have a firm grasp of the fundamental elements of the JavaScript language. You'll have your environment set up, and you'll get a short introduction into test driven development; a lot of ground to cover in only a few short minutes.

The homework includes initial JavaScript environment setup, and requires you to create Feynman writing prompts, then code those concepts."

### "Control Flow in JavaScript"
- [LESSON TWO](https://youtu.be/4LNf5qcQWHQ)  
"This lesson covers git and Github, loops, if/then/else statements, &, ||, !=, and other concepts.

For the homework you'll fork and clone a repository from Github, make changes until tests pass, and push the repository back up."

# git / GitHub note:
I initialized this repository as a local `git init` and **_then_** set up the GitHub repository.  
- `mkdir JavaScript-mini-bootcamp`
- `cd JavaScript-mini-bootcamp`
- `git init`
- `touch README.md`
- `touch .gitignore`
- `git status`
- `git add .`
- `git commit -m "first!"`
- @GitHub.com I made a new repository: "JavaScript-mini-bootcamp" (no README.md or .gitignore)
- copied the URL: https://github.com/mixelpixel/JavaScript-mini-bootcamp.git
- `git remote add origin https://github.com/mixelpixel/JavaScript-mini-bootcamp.git`
- `git remote -v`
- `git push -u origin master`
