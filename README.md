## Lesson One
### "Introduction to JavaScript"
- [LESSON ONE](https://youtu.be/fjjebMXE-P8)
"This introductory lesson covers variables and operators, functions, data types, and the Math object. It also touches lightly on Node, GitHub, and npm.  

By the time you finish this lesson (and the accompanying homework) you should have a firm grasp of the fundamental elements of the JavaScript language. You'll have your environment set up, and you'll get a short introduction into test driven development; a lot of ground to cover in only a few short minutes.

The homework includes initial JavaScript environment setup, and requires you to create Feynman writing prompts, then code those concepts."
